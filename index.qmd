::: {#hero-heading}
I am currently a student of the [European Doctoral School of Demography](https://eaps.nl/edsd/About-EDSD){target="_blank"} (EDSD), hosted by [Institut National d'Études Démographiques](https://www.ined.fr/en/){target="_blank"} (INED). I'm sponsored by the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/about_us_6113/the_max_planck_institute_for_demographic_research_6653/){target="_blank"}.

I'm mainly interested in inequalities in childhood. I've participated in cross-country projects investigating possible factors that influence disparities in child development, including, but not limited to: parental socioeconomic status, tracking at school, family structure, parenting styles, gender.

Most often, I adopt a longitudinal approach with survey data. Datasets I'm most familiar with include Étude Longitudinale Française depuis l'Enfance (Elfe), Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), Direction de l'évaluation, de la prospective et de la performance (DEPP), European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).

## The skills that help us do and convey our research

I'm always excited to talk about the skills that help us with our research, such as public speaking, writing, coding, and self-reflection. We develop these as we accumulate experience, but I'm sure that talking and reading about them can help too. Reach out to me if you share this interest.

**Love, Money, and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids**, by Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti

When I tell people I've graduated in economics, they tend to ask me about financial markets, or about taxes. I was also puzzled as to where economics started and ended, especially given my interest in family and childhood. This book is a page-turner in itself, but on top of that, it finally cleared up for me how the prism of economics could further our understanding of parenting and childhood inequalities.

I love showing my (patient) loved ones the introduction of this book: "See, this is what I do!"

**Where Research Begins: Choosing a Research Project That Matters to You (and the World)**, by Thomas S. Mullaney and Christopher Rea

Boy, I wish someone had pointed me to this book when I was trying to figure out my research question for my Master's degree thesis at Paris School of Economics. Instead, I found it while bookshop browsing ([here](https://www.toppingbooks.co.uk/collections/edinburgh/){target="_blank"}).

**Writing Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded**, by Joshua Schimel

Schimel's research "sits at the interface of ecosystem and microbial ecology". That is to say that the examples he uses in his book on writing are tough to understand. Yet, this is the book I would recommend to help feel less anxious when faced with the noble task of writing.

**Write It Up: Practical Strategies for Writing and Publishing Journal Articles**, by Paul J. Silvia

This book is very down to earth when giving tips on team work, picking journals, tone and style of writing, and lots more. I like that its authors take positions on pet peeves. It's refreshing.

**A Field Guide to Grad School: Uncovering the Hidden Curriculum**, by Jessica McCrory Calarco

What a madhouse academia can be. I love that Jessica McCrory Calarco wrote a book to help young researchers save themselves some pain. It also helps lighten the load of our best mentors out there, who might sacrifice their focus on their own research when spending time supporting their mentorees. A lot of this book's advice applies to the US context a lot better, but for me, just acknowledging some of the madness does it.
