::: {#hero-heading}
I am currently a student of the [European Doctoral School of Demography](https://eaps.nl/edsd/About-EDSD){target="_blank"} (EDSD), hosted by [Institut National d'Études Démographiques](https://www.ined.fr/en/){target="_blank"} (INED). I'm sponsored by the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/about_us_6113/the_max_planck_institute_for_demographic_research_6653/){target="_blank"} (MPIDR). Starting in September/October 2025, I'll be funded by INED to complete my PhD thesis at the [Centre for Research on social InequalitieS](https://www.sciencespo.fr/cris/en/presentation/){target="_blank"} (CRIS) at Sciences Po.

I mainly focus on inequalities in childhood. I've participated in cross-country projects investigating possible factors that influence disparities in child development, including, but not limited to: parental socioeconomic status, tracking at school, family structure, parenting styles, gender.

Most often, I adopt a longitudinal approach with survey data. Datasets I'm most familiar with include Étude Longitudinale Française depuis l'Enfance (Elfe), Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), Direction de l'évaluation, de la prospective et de la performance (DEPP), European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).
