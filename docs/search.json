    "text": "Books!\nPeople who know me know books are one of the loves of my life. And they’ve found their way into my research.\nHere are some of my favourites.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove, Money, and Parenting: How Economics Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids, by Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti\nPrinceton University Press’s Website\nWhen I tell people I’ve graduated in economics, they tend to ask me about financial markets, or about taxes. I was also puzzled as to where economics started and ended, especially given my interest in family and childhood. This book is a page-turner in itself, but on top of that, it finally cleared up for me how the prism of economics could further our understanding of parenting and childhood inequalities.\nI love showing my (patient) loved ones the introduction of this book: “See, this is what I do!!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Research Begins: Choosing a Research Project That Matters to You (and the World), by Thomas S. Mullaney and Christopher Rea\nChicago Press’s website\nBoy, I wish someone had pointed me to this book when I was trying to figure out my research question for my Master’s degree thesis at Paris School of Economics. Instead, I found it while bookshop browsing (here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded, by Joshua Schimel\nJosh Schimel’s website\nSchimel’s research “sits at the interface of ecosystem and microbial ecology”. That is to say that the examples he uses in his book on writing are tough to understand. Yet, this is the book I would recommend to help feel less anxious when faced with the noble task of writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite It Up: Practical Strategies for Writing and Publishing Journal Articles, by Paul J. Silvia\nAPA’s website\nThis book is very down to earth when giving tips on team work, picking journals, tone and style of writing, and lots more. I like that its authors take positions on pet peeves. It’s refreshing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Field Guide to Grad School: Uncovering the Hidden Curriculum, by Jessica McCrory Calarco\nPrinceton University Press’s website\nWhat a madhouse academia can be. I love that Jessica McCrory Calarco wrote a book to help young researchers save themselves some pain. It also helps lighten the load of our best mentors out there, who might sacrifice their focus on their own research when spending time supporting their mentorees. A lot of this book’s advice applies to the US context a lot better, but for me, just acknowledging some of the madness does it.\n\n\n\nI love book recommendations, let me know what your favourites are.\n\nAnd so many more"
